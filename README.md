## \[\[A database password retriever/unlocker


</div>

### Description

This project is a database opener which basically opens any MSAccess database w/o knowing the password. The main purpose of the program is to open a passworded database, and retrieve the password. This is helpful for databases with forgoten passwords. The program requires a "Character Set"- this is where the program retrieves several combinations for unlocking the password. if you suspect the database to include numbers and special characters simply include them in the Character Set. the program runs perfectly on high-end machines, but using it on lower-end machines do take awhile. please feel free to comment & vote! :) special thanks to §e7eN for the bruteforce class! =)
